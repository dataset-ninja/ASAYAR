The authors of **ASAYAR** dataset collected 1765 images from Moroccan highways, covering two round trips totaling approximately 2000 km.It includes two round trips: the first one from Oujda to Rabat, and
the second one from Tangier to Casablanca. The images, recorded with a Nikon D3300 camera with 24 megapixels and a Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone camera with 13 megapixels, feature various types of Moroccan highway panels, including Arabic/French text, regulatory signs, and warning traffic signs, with consideration given to environmental factors during the data annotation process.

The labelers of ASAYAR invested over 2000 hours of work, spanning nine months, to manually annotate the dataset. The annotated detection dataset is organized into three foldersâ€”ASAYAR_SIGN for traffic sign objects, ASAYAR_TXT for text-based panels with word and line level annotations, and ASAYAR_SYM for panels featuring annotated directional symbols.

The authors employed the stratified sampling method to divide the sub-datasets into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, ensuring balanced classes in each. For ASAYAR_SIGN, the training set comprises 1416 images, with 349 in the testing set. ASAYAR_TXT includes 1100 training samples and 275 testing samples, incorporating both word-level and line-level datasets. Lastly, ASAYAR_SYM has 444 images for training and 114 for testing.
